# pong_game
Challenge your friend to a game of Pong!

[Click here to play.](http://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user301_AMinBEz0iR_0.py)

Select "run" to start the game. 2 people can play. The person on the left side controls their paddle using the "w" and 
"s" keys. The person on the right controls their paddle using the up and down arrows. The first person to score 5 points wins!
Note: Due to a glitch in the interpreter, if you expand the game viewer you must select "New Game" for the controls to work properly.

It is run in your browser using CodeSkulptor: a browser-based Python interpreter that implements a subset of Python 3, plus the addition of three graphical libraries, SimpleGui, SimpleMap, and SimplePlot. CodeSkulptor runs in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
